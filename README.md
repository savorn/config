### What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are configuration files for unix-like OS/distro (debian, ubuntu, macOS, openBSD, etc). 
They are called dotfiles because the files are usually preceded with a dot (e.g. .vimrc, .bashrc, .xinitrc) or 
the folders are usually preceded with a dot (e.g. /home/savorn/.config).
