# dotfiles
### What are *dotfiles*?
*Dotfiles* are user-specific configuration files for different applications on Unix-like operating systems such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora or macOS.
These files are located inside the user's home directory (e.g. /home/savorn/).
Files can be named preceded with a dot (e.g. /home/savorn/**.vimrc**) or located in a directory preceded with a dot (e.g. /home/savorn/**.config/**).

This respository keeps track of all the changes to my dotfiles.
